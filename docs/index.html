                    <h3>Piano Tiles Gameplay Experience</h3>
                    <p>PianoMaker transforms piano learning into an immersive gaming experience with our Piano Tiles player. Notes cascade down the screen like Guitar Hero, providing real-time visual guidance that shows you exactly when to press each key. This gamification approach makes practice sessions feel less like work and more like entertainment, dramatically increasing engagement and practice time. The visual feedback helps you develop better timing and rhythm naturally, while the game-like progression keeps you motivated to improve. Perfect for visual learners who struggle with traditional sheet music, and engaging enough to keep even beginners practicing for hours without realizing how much they're learning.</p>

PianoMaker is the only piano learning platform that integrates with social media, allowing you to learn viral songs the moment they become popular.

Simply paste the link from any social media platform, and our AI instantly transcribes it into playable piano notes complete with Piano Tiles visualization. This feature is perfect for content creators who want to learn trending songs for their own videos, music enthusiasts who want to play what they hear on social media, or anyone who wants their piano repertoire to reflect contemporary popular music rather than being limited to classical pieces and old standards.</p>

                    <p>Unlike platforms that simply give you notes to play, PianoMaker provides a comprehensive learning system for every single song. Each piece comes with customized warm-up exercises to prepare your fingers, detailed fingering guides showing optimal hand positions, technique drills targeting specific challenges in the song, and progressive difficulty levels that let you master sections gradually before attempting the full arrangement. This structured approach ensures you're not just memorizing songs, but actually developing proper piano technique, muscle memory, and musical understanding. The system adapts to your skill level, breaking complex pieces into manageable sections and providing practice exercises that build the specific skills needed for each song. It's like having a professional piano teacher embedded in every lesson, guiding you from your first notes to advanced performance.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">Is PianoMaker really completely free?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Yes, PianoMaker is 100% FREE FOREVER with no hidden costs, subscription fees, or premium tiers. You get unlimited access to all features including AI transcription, Piano Tiles gameplay, social media imports, structured lessons, and professional export options. We don't require a credit card, and there are no feature limitations or trial periods. Unlike Songscription which charges $19.99/month, PianoMaker believes music education should be accessible to everyone regardless of financial circumstances. Our mission is to democratize piano learning by providing professional-quality tools completely free of charge. We're committed to keeping the platform free forever because we believe everyone deserves the opportunity to learn music.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How is PianoMaker different from Songscription?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The main differences are that PianoMaker is completely free while Songscription requires a paid subscription, PianoMaker offers an interactive Piano Tiles gameplay experience that Songscription lacks, and PianoMaker allows direct imports from TikTok, Instagram, and SoundCloud which Songscription doesn't support. Additionally, PianoMaker provides comprehensive structured learning with warm-ups, fingering guides, and technique drills for every song, whereas Songscription focuses primarily on transcription without the pedagogical framework. PianoMaker works directly in your browser on any device without requiring app downloads, making it more accessible. The combination of gamified learning through Piano Tiles, social media integration, structured technique development, and completely free access makes PianoMaker a superior choice for modern piano learners who want an engaging, comprehensive, and affordable learning experience.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What is the Piano Tiles feature and how does it help me learn?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Piano Tiles is an interactive gameplay feature where musical notes fall down the screen in real-time, showing you exactly when to press each key on your piano or keyboard. It works similarly to rhythm games like Guitar Hero but specifically designed for piano learning. As you play along, the visual feedback helps you develop better timing, rhythm, and finger coordination naturally. The gaming aspect makes practice sessions more engaging and fun, dramatically increasing the amount of time students spend practicing. Research shows that gamification in music education increases retention and motivation, which is why Piano Tiles is so effective. The visual nature of falling notes is particularly helpful for beginners who struggle with reading traditional sheet music, and it helps intermediate players tackle complex pieces by breaking them into manageable, real-time visual chunks. The system provides immediate feedback on timing and accuracy, helping you improve faster than traditional learning methods.</div>
